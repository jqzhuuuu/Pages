## Some things I *hate*:
 1. My past mistakes and how embarassing they were in the moment
    - Ever just shake half of an esports team's hands and forget the other half then ***LEAVE***? I hate myself

    - But combined with other things is good, like tomato + eggs, ketchup, pastas, etc.
 3. People who aren't nice on the road :<
    - Please don't try to swerve around me when I'm driving 25 in a neighborhood
 4. Roommates who don't wash their dishes
    - As my other roommates would say:
        > If you were responsible, you clean it up
